## 日本房价分析和预测

我们组项目是日本房价分析和预测。

Our team's project involves the analysis and prediction of Japanese real estate prices.

# 项目背景

近些年来日本房产的波动趋势较大，房价趋势受经济因素，人口因素，利率因素，供求关系等等因素影响，为了预测未来房价的趋势，我们组尝试从人口，经济两个主要因素来进行分析。

In recent years, the Japanese real estate market has exhibited significant fluctuations. The trends in property prices are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, demographics, interest rates, supply and demand dynamics, and more. In an effort to forecast future trends in property prices, our team is focusing on analyzing the two primary factors of demographics and the economy.

## 1.相关背景数据

所有前期背景数据都是来源于日本内阁府白皮书所公布的，数据过于宽泛，用作大致分析，在后续会利用更加精细的数据进行进一步的分析。

All the preliminary background data have been sourced from the white papers published by the Japanese Cabinet Office. Due to the broad nature of the data, they have been used for a general analysis. In the subsequent stages, we intend to employ more refined data for further in-depth analysis.

### 1.1人口
